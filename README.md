# RiverAnalysis
A page hosting work for local river analysis

# H1 Project One: Using USGS REST API services to collect, organize, and relate downstream and upstream river gauges.
- This is based on basic hydrology where: In == Out.
- The purpose is to understand downstream response to precipitation. This will aid in understanding timelag for the downstream gauge to "feel" rainfall. 

# H2 Simply put... when can I expect the best response to take my whitewater kayak to the local surf wave?
