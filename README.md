# RiverAnalysis
A page hosting work for local river analysis

# [Project One: Using USGS REST API services to collect, organize, and relate downstream and upstream river gauges.](https://andrewpark467.github.io/RiverAnalysis/)
- This is based on basic hydrology where: In == Out.
- The purpose is to understand downstream response to precipitation. This will aid in understanding timelag for the downstream gauge to "feel" rainfall. 

## Simply put... when can I expect the best response to take my ==whitewater kayak to the local surf wave==?
